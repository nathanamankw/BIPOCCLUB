## BIPOC Business Society - University of Ottawa (Telfer School of Management)
### Target: $50,000+ in High-Value Sponsorship Revenue

---

## MASTER SPONSOR LIST - RATED BY LIKELIHOOD & VALUE

### RATING SYSTEM
- **LIKELIHOOD**: % chance of securing funds (based on program fit, existing relationships, DEI commitment)
- **VALUE**: Dollar amount achievable
- **PRIORITY**: When to apply

---

## TIER 1: HIGHEST PROBABILITY ($22,000 - $45,000 potential)

### 1. SCOTIABANK - ScotiaRISE Program
- **Ask Amount**: $5,000 - $10,000/year (multi-year: $15,000-$30,000 over 3 years)
- **Likelihood**: 85%
- **Program**: ScotiaRISE / Community Sponsorship via Benevity portal
- **Focus Area**: "Remove Barriers to Career Advancement"
- **Why High Likelihood**: Form EXPLICITLY tracks BIPOC KPIs. Multi-year funding (1-5 years) available. You already have their application on file. Their KPI "Hours of re-skilling or career-related training provided to BIPOC populations" maps DIRECTLY to BBS mission.
- **Loophole**: Apply under SPONSORSHIP track (not donation). Select "Remove barriers to career advancement." Frame as annual capacity-building partnership, NOT event funding. Money becomes unrestricted operating revenue.
- **Application**: Rolling intake via Benevity Causes Portal. Allow 90 days for response.
- **URL**: https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/responsibility/community/sponsorships.html
- **APPLY BY**: March 2025

### 2. RBC - Sponsorium / RBC Future Launch
- **Ask Amount**: $3,000 - $10,000
- **Likelihood**: 80%
- **Program**: RBC Community Sponsorship (via Sponsorium platform) + RBC Future Launch Partnership
- **Why High Likelihood**: RBC committed $50M to BIPOC youth through Future Launch. They explicitly distinguish between sponsoring an "event" vs an "organization" - select ORGANIZATION. RBC has dedicated campus recruitment budgets for diverse student orgs.
- **Loophole**: On the RBC Sponsorium form, select "Organization" as Sponsorship Opportunity Type (not "Event"). This makes the funds tied to BBS as an org, not any specific event. Frame as "BIPOC Leadership Development Organization" seeking annual partnership.
- **Application**: Year-round via Sponsorium platform
- **URL**: https://www.rbc.com/community-social-impact/apply-for-funding/index.html
- **APPLY BY**: March 2025

### 3. CGI GROUP - Renew & Expand Existing Contract
- **Ask Amount**: $3,000 - $5,000 (expand from current)
- **Likelihood**: 90%
- **Why High Likelihood**: YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ACTIVE SPONSORSHIP CONTRACT (CGI Sponsorship Contract.docx). This is a renewal/expansion, not a cold pitch. CGI HQ is in Montreal with major Ottawa presence.
- **Loophole**: Use the existing contract as your template for ALL other corporate pitches. Propose expanding the partnership to include a paid "DEI Advisory Panel" ($1,500-$2,000 additional revenue).
- **Contact**: Existing CGI contact from current contract
- **APPLY BY**: April 2025 (before contract cycle ends)

### 4. SHOPIFY - Community/Campus Partnership
- **Ask Amount**: $3,000 - $10,000
- **Likelihood**: 70%
- **Why High Likelihood**: Shopify is HEADQUARTERED IN OTTAWA, actively recruits from uOttawa, and has community investment budgets. Local proximity = strong fit.
- **Loophole**: Pitch a "Shopify x BBS Entrepreneurship Series" - Shopify's brand = entrepreneurship + diverse founders. Frame as annual brand partnership with recruitment pipeline access. Payment is unrestricted.
- **Caveat**: Shopify has recently scaled back DEI programs - approach their Community & Social Impact team OR Campus Recruitment directly. Recruitment budgets are separate from DEI budgets.
- **Contact**: Shopify Community & Social Impact team / University Relations
- **APPLY BY**: May-July 2025 (for September start)

### 5. BIG 4 FIRMS (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC) - Campus Recruitment Partnerships
- **Ask Amount**: $1,000 - $3,000 EACH (combined: $4,000 - $12,000)
- **Likelihood**: 75% (per firm)
- **Why High Likelihood**: All 4 have Ottawa offices near Telfer. All have dedicated diversity recruitment budgets separate from their marketing budgets. Student business club sponsorships are standard practice.
- **Loophole**: Contact Campus Recruitment / HR Inclusion teams (NOT marketing departments). Recruitment budgets are larger and more flexible. Sell "Talent Pipeline Access" packages:
  - Bronze ($1,000): Logo at career events + resume book access
  - Silver ($2,000): + dedicated info session + newsletter mentions
  - Gold ($3,000): + co-branded mentorship program + priority recruiting
- **Contact**: Each firm's Ottawa office Campus Recruiter or DEI lead

- **APPLY BY**: March 2025

### 7. TD BANK - Ready Commitment Community Sponsorship
- **Ask Amount**: $2,000 - $5,000
- **Likelihood**: 60%
- **Program**: TD Community Sponsorship (4 deadlines/year)

## THE 7 LOOPHOLE STRATEGIES (HOW TO KEEP MONEY UNRESTRICTED)

### LOOPHOLE 1: CAPACITY BUILDING FRAMING
- Frame ALL asks as "organizational development" / "leadership training" / "capacity building"
- Language: "BBS seeks a capacity-building partner to support our annual BIPOC Leadership Development Program"
- When sponsors ask "what will you use the money for?" say: "Organizational capacity, professional development programming, and leadership training for BIPOC business students"
- AETSA tracks sponsorship revenue separately - your sponsorship money is NOT subject to AETSA's eligible/ineligible expense rules

### LOOPHOLE 2: RECRUITMENT PIPELINE PACKAGES
- Sell "Talent Pipeline Access" to corporations - they're paying for recruiting access, not funding an event
- Create tiered packages: Bronze ($500) / Silver ($1,500) / Gold ($3,000) / Platinum ($5,000)
- Pitch to HR/DEI departments, NOT marketing departments (bigger budgets, more flexible)
- Revenue classified as "partnership fees" - entirely unrestricted

### LOOPHOLE 3: ANNUAL BRAND PARTNERSHIP (NOT EVENT SPONSORSHIP)
- Sell year-round brand visibility (logo on merch, social media, website, newsletter)
- Payment is for "annual brand partnership" - decoupled from any specific event
- Key: AETSA won't fund merch, but sponsor-funded merch = free inventory you can sell to members
- 3-5 brand partners at $1,000-$3,000 each = $3,000-$15,000 unrestricted

### LOOPHOLE 4: IN-KIND SWAPS THAT FREE UP CASH
- Get sponsors to cover costs you'd otherwise pay for (Canva, printing, food, merch, software)
- Every $1 of in-kind = $1 freed up in your general fund
- Track as "In-Kind Sponsorship Revenue" + matching expense (zeros out but shows value)
- Canva nonprofit program = free Canva Pro (saves ~$200/year)
- Sponsor-funded merch: Company pays $2,000 for 100 co-branded hoodies, you sell at $25 each = $2,500 revenue to BBS

### LOOPHOLE 5: MULTI-YEAR MOUs WITH FLEXIBILITY CLAUSE
- Lock sponsors into 2-3 year agreements for revenue predictability
- KEY CLAUSE: "The specific allocation of sponsorship funds across BBS programming will be determined annually by the BBS executive team in consultation with [Sponsor]"
- This clause = money is unrestricted because YOU decide allocation each year
- Scotiabank's form explicitly supports multi-year funding (1-5 years)

### LOOPHOLE 6: NAMED AWARDS WITH ADMIN FEES
- Create "[Sponsor] BIPOC Business Excellence Award" - $1,000 to student, $500 to BBS for "administration"
- Call it an "award" NOT "scholarship" (scholarships must go through university financial aid office)
- Sponsor gets DEI reporting value, student wins money, BBS keeps admin portion
- TD won't fund scholarships but WILL fund "awards programs"

### LOOPHOLE 7: PAID CONSULTING & ADVISORY SERVICES
- Sell "DEI Student Advisory Panel" sessions to companies ($500-$1,500/session)
- Run focus groups: charge company $1,200, pay each of 10 participants $50 gift card, BBS keeps $700
- Commission campus surveys for corporate clients ($500-$1,000/report)
- Invoice using your existing BBS Invoice Template
- Revenue classified as "Service Revenue" - completely unrestricted

## AETSA COMPLIANCE NOTES

2. **Sponsorship revenue is NOT subject** to AETSA eligible/ineligible expense rules
3. **All revenue must flow through** BBS's official chequing account (ending in 1726)
4. **Document everything**: Log all sponsorship revenue in your financial logbook with sponsor name, amount, date, and purpose
5. **Keep clear separation**: AETSA-funded expenses vs. sponsorship-funded expenses must be distinguishable in your books
6. **Merch, office supplies, team bonding** = AETSA-ineligible but CAN be funded from sponsorship revenue
7. **All contracts over $1,000** should have written agreements
